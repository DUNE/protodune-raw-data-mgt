# Data Management for protoDUNE
## Overview
This is repository contains documents for a proposed raw data managment system for the protoDUNE detectors:
* NP02 - the dual-phase detector
* NP04 - the single-phase detector

## Documents in this repository
* *protoDUNE-DMS-design.tex is the MAIN document*. It describes a specific design of the data management system based on deployment and reuse of F-FTS, which is a data management system supported by FNAL.
* The file pdrdm.tex and the two charts that go in it,
"flow" and "state", is an initial note evaluating basic design requirements.

* The file spbf.tex is work in progress and will describe the Single-Phase protoDUNE Disk Buffer Farm

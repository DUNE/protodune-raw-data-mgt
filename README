This is repository contains documents for a proposed raw data managment system for the protoDUNE detectors:
* NP02 - the dual-phase detector
* NP04 - the single-phase detector

 (SP and DP).  It's currently a work in progress
and needs input from the various primaries.

The file pdrdm.tex and the two charts that go in it,
"flow" and "state", is an initial note evaluating basic design requirements.

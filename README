This is repository contains documents for a proposed raw data managment system for the protoDUNE detectors:
* NP02 - the dual-phase detector
* NP04 - the single-phase detector

The file pdrdm.tex and the two charts that go in it,
"flow" and "state", is an initial note evaluating basic design requirements.

The file protoDUNE-DMS-design.tex describes a specific approach to the design of the data management system based on deployment and reuse of F-FTS, which is a data management system supported by FNAL.

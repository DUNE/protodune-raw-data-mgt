+++ ATTENTION: protoDUNE-DMS-design.tex is the main source of the current document +++

A.
This is repository contains documents for a proposed raw data managment system for the protoDUNE detectors:
* NP02 - the dual-phase detector
* NP04 - the single-phase detector

B.
The file pdrdm.tex and the two charts that go in it,
"flow" and "state", is an initial note evaluating basic design requirements.

C.
The file protoDUNE-DMS-design.tex describes a design of the data management system based on deployment and reuse of F-FTS, which is a data management system supported by FNAL. This is currently THE content of this document branch
